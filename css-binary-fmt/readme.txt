=======WHAT IS THIS CODE

This is an encoder for CSS which generates a binary format. The overly verbose nature of formats like JSON and XML have given rise to binary versions of their data in order to save transfer size, and are used by many large companies due to their savings. Although playing “Follow the leader” isn’t my style, I decided to try my hand at a binary version of CSS would be similarly successful.
